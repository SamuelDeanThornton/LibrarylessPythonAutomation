# LibrarylessPythonAutomation
What it says on the tin

A repo to store several python files realated to automation of various processes, such as image confolution, file conversion and desktop cleanup.
Simple concept, however to add challenge I will use no libraries in these scripts, instead coding the necessary functions myself.
